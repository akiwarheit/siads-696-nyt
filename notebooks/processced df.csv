He runs with certainty, guided by the white lines and the white bases, circling in the hope that he will arrive safely at the same place from where he departed.

For the first time since emergency drought regulations took effect this year, Californians failed to meet the 25 percent water reduction target set by Gov. Jerry Brown. Residents reduced their water used in October by 22.2 percent compared with 2013, the state’s lowest conservation rate since mandatory water reductions began in the summer. Over all, residents remain on a pace to meet the 25 percent goal, having saved 27.1 percent over 2013 in the five months from June to October. State water officials have said saving water will be more difficult during the winter because Californians used less water during the winter in years past. They said they expected conservation rates to remain lower during the colder months. “I was relieved at the numbers,” Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, said of October’s 22 percent figure.

It piques both the voyeur and the skeptic in us.” Mr. Sehgal, who lives in Berlin and studied political economy and dance, has cleared out the Guggenheim for his self-titled exhibition, which runs through March 10. “Yet the space isn’t empty. On the rotunda’s ground floor, a man and woman entwine in a changing, slow-motion amorous embrace” and “on the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away.” Mr. Sehgal’s art is made up almost entirely of such balletic tableaus and social encounters; it’s bare-bones but “addictive” and makes you want to return for more.

In a 32-page filing, they asked a federal appeals court to grant a change of venue, or at a minimum to order the trial judge, George A. O’Toole Jr., to hold a hearing on moving the trial.

United States District Judge Stephen Larson denied MGA’s request, saying it was premature while he was considering post-trial motions to be argued at a Feb. 11 hearing. On Jan. 5, the judge will hold a separate hearing at which MGA lawyers said he would consider extending the delay at least to the end of 2009 instead. Judge Larson ruled on Dec. 3 that MGA may no longer make most of the Bratz dolls that have contributed to a drop in Mattel’s Barbie sales since they were first brought on the market in 2001. A jury earlier found that a Mattel designer had come up with the Bratz name and characters and secretly had taken the idea to MGA.

Or it did, at least, by the time the Jules Verne novel that tells the tale was adapted into Mike Todd’s all-star 1956 Hollywood movie.

Brief,National,U.S.,"A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Friday preventing new regulations from taking effect that would have forced the closing of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Friday preventing new regulations from taking effect that would have forced the closing of two of the state’s three abortion clinics. The clinics have been unable to meet requirements of the regulations, which were issued this month and were supposed to take effect on Friday. A third clinic, operated by Planned Parenthood, was granted a license this week. In an hourlong hearing in District Court in Kansas City, lawyers for the state argued the regulations represented an appropriate way to protect the safety of patients, while lawyers for the clinics called them unnecessarily onerous. The judge, Carlos Murgia, noted that one provider had turned down two women seeking abortions because of fetal abnormalities as evidence that there would be irreparable harm if the regulations were allowed to go into effect pending the outcome of the case.

Three of those freed were women, and according to videos and photographs, some appeared to be elderly men. Dawoud Dawoud, an official with the Assyrian Democratic Organization, said that Islamic State fighters were reported to be looting some of the villages they seized along the Khabur River, where many of the hostages were captured. Scores of the captives remain unaccounted for, though Sunni Arab local leaders have been mediating between Assyrian Christian leaders and Islamic State militants to free the rest, officials said. Meanwhile, the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State bombed targets near Hasaka for the third day in a row, according to Central Command. The strikes suggested a stepped-up operation in response to the advance by Islamic State militants that drove more than 1,000 of the Assyrian Christians, a minority in Syria, from their homes.

Protests against hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for shale gas in southern Algeria turned violent over the weekend when the police clashed with demonstrators outside a base run by the American company Halliburton near the town of Ain Salah. Tensions were still running high on Sunday, but no further violence was reported. Antifracking protests against the government oil and gas company Sonatrach and its international partners have occurred almost daily for two months, but had been peaceful until now. Clashes broke out when protesters approached Halliburton’s walled compound and burned tires in the roads. The police fired tear gas and detained at least a dozen. About 20 protesters were injured, three of them seriously, according to a local hospital. Algeria, which gets much of its revenue from the export of oil and gas, has been conducting a pilot project to test for shale gas near Ain Salah and announced in December that it was ready to start extracting gas by hydraulic fracturing. Groups that oppose the government have joined the local protesters in Ain Salah to demand a moratorium on fracking, citing environmental concerns.

A federal appeals judge allowed Texas to ban Planned Parenthood clinics from participating in a health care program for low-income women late Monday night, hours after a lower court prohibited the state from doing so. The decision by the appellate judge was the latest twist in a dispute between Texas officials and Planned Parenthood that threatens a health program that serves more than 100,000 women. At issue is a state rule requiring all providers in the Medicaid Women’s Health Program to certify that they do not affiliate with entities that perform or promote abortions. Nine Planned Parenthood clinics that do not perform abortions sued the state. On Monday, Judge Lee Yeakel of Federal District Court blocked the state from enforcing the rule, but the state attorney general appealed, and Judge Jerry E.

As a result, state health officials said on Tuesday that they had begun banning all abortion providers and affiliates from the program.

The bill matters, not just to Canada but to the world: The boreal forests and tundra of northern Canada remain a relatively intact ecosystem, absorbing more carbon than the world’s tropical forests and providing a vital buffer against global warming.

Brief,Foreign,World,"Russia on Friday blamed the West for blocking a Security Council statement that sought “humanitarian pauses” in the Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen.  In an outburst of diplomatic finger-pointing, Russia on Friday blamed the West for blocking a Security Council statement that sought “humanitarian pauses” in the Saudi-led airstrikes on Yemen to allow the delivery of food, fuel and medicine. Emerging from an emergency session of the Council, the Russian ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, said Yemen was running out of food and medicine and sharply suggested that the United States, which supports the bombings, is responsible for their humanitarian consequences. Russia had proposed a statement that would be unenforceable, and not legally binding. “If you can’t agree to a motherhood and apple pie statement, what can you agree on?” he said. The criticism was in sharp contrast to Russia’s response to efforts by Western countries over the last couple of years to force the Syrian government, which Russia supports, to allow aid convoys into rebel-held areas. In a statement, an American official said Washington supported the idea of a humanitarian pause and was working with its Saudi allies to facilitate the delivery of aid.

Op-Ed,Opinion & Editorial,Opinion,"Focusing on pastors with opposing views on same-sex marriage, the filmmaker Yoruba Richen explores the influence of African-Americans on a ballot initiative in Maryland. I began conceiving of this documentary on election night in 2008. I was in California, where marriage equality was on the ballot in the form of Proposition 8. As the night progressed, it became clear that same-sex couples in California would lose their recently won right to marry. The elation that many felt about President Obama’s election was countered by spontaneous protests and visible outrage at this inequity. Almost immediately, it was wrongly reported that the African-American community had voted for Proposition 8 by 70 percent. Many of us watched in horror as latent resentments, outright racism and homophobia bubbled to the top of the national political scene. It was then that I decided to make a documentary to explore the complicated relationship between the African-American and gay civil rights movements.

Review,BookReview,Books,"The cold war era is mainly important for the nuclear war that never happened. Neil Sheehan succesfully dramatizes this nonevent through the story of Gen. Bernard Schriever, a crucial figure behind the creation of America’s ICBM force. When we think about how America won the cold war, our attention tends to fasten on grand, public moments of presidential leadership, like Truman’s decision to resist Stalin’s designs on Europe, Kennedy’s settlement of the Cuban missile crisis or Reagan’s realization that he could “do business” with Mikhail Gorbachev. This is not wrong, but it elides other pivot-points, invisible to Americans even as they were happening, that, in retrospect, loom almost as important. The C.I.A.’s hidden success in assessing the Soviet war machine is one example. Another consists of the crucial Pentagon decisions, unheralded at the time, that ensured our ability to match Soviet power and enforce an armed stalemate between the two superpowers until, as George Kennan had forecast in the late 1940s, the Soviet empire collapsed from within.

Review,BookReview,Books,"In Richard Powers’s latest novel, characters obsess over a woman ostensibly afflicted with hyperthymia — an excess of happiness. For the past 20 years or so, Richard Powers seems to have been engaged in a prodigious attempt to redress the imbalance of knowledge that was the subject of C. P. Snow’s famous “Two Cultures” lecture. That, you will recall, was the one in which Snow, a British scientist and novelist, bemoaned the breakdown of communication between the sciences and the humanities. Unlike most of his novelistic peers, Powers speaks fluent science and technology. As a longtime reader of the mostly rapturous reviews of his novels, written by humanists who seemed deeply intimidated by his mastery of arcane branches of scientific knowledge, I managed — until recently — to avoid cracking any of them. As it turns out, his new novel, “Generosity,” is an excellent introduction to Powers’s work, a lighter, leaner treatment of his favorite themes and techniques.  Why Is She Smiling?

Review,BookReview,Books,"The Scottish-born comedian tells his story without jokes getting in the way. Craig Ferguson isn’t kidding. That’s what struck me as I turned the pages of the Scottish late-night comedian’s memoir, “American on Purpose: The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot.” Almost every time Ferguson has a chance to go for a cheap, easy laugh — the mother’s milk of late-night comedy — he runs in the opposite direction. Take the opening scene in which he meets George W. Bush at a reception before the 2008 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, where Ferguson, a newly minted American citizen, is to be the entertainment. He recognizes that making fun of Bush near the end of his catastrophic presidency would be like shooting fish in a barrel, so what does he do instead? He bonds with Bush as a fellow recovering alcoholic, clinking glasses of sparkling water with him as the president makes an earnest toast to America. I repeat: this is the opening scene of a book by a comedian. That’s what we in the comedy business call courage, and it pretty much sets the tone for the rest of this memoir, in which Ferguson admirably avoids wisecracks and instead goes for something like wisdom.

Review,BookReview,Books,"Edmund White recalls gay life in New York in the 1960s and ’70s, when friends and sheer perseverance got him through his years of desire, poverty and thwarted ambition. In the early 1980s, when I was in college, Edmund White’s work was a revelation to me. I lay around my Barnard dorm room listening to Nina Simone records and reading his first novel, “Forgetting Elena,” which takes place in a highly mythopoeticized version of Fire Island and nominally concerns a man with amnesia. Radically and unabashedly lyrical, polymorphously sexual, phantasmagoric, finely wrought and peculiar, “Forgetting Elena” showed me that beauty could be a gun. Its excess was its ars poetica, an invitation and an argument about appetite, possibility and the uses of pleasure. His second novel, “Nocturnes for the King of Naples,” opened with the most gorgeous evocation I have ever read of the 1970s gay male nighttown at New York’s old rotting piers, a twisted, rusting, metallic ruin of anonymous sex and unexpectedly sublime tableaus. I wanted to go there — not to the piers, where girls wouldn’t have been welcome anyway, but to the mind-set that apprehended the world that way, as an abundant, carnal and glittering place, populated by fearless, libidinal aesthetes.

Review,BookReview,Books,"Two scholars argue that our actions and emotions are affected not only by those close to us, but by people we may not even know. For those of us not actively toiling in a university, most modern writing in the social sciences can be placed into one of three categories. The first category, which is vast, consists of the arcane and the incremental — those studies so obscure, or which advance scholarship so infinitesimally, that they can be safely ignored by the general reader. (Not that this work isn’t important; it keeps academic publishing in business, and significant knowledge accretes in tiny drips on the way to tenure.) The second category consists of statistical proof of the obvious. (Some actual study findings published recently: “the parent-child relationship . . . commonly includes feelings of irritation, tension and ambivalence”; women are more likely to engage in casual sex with “an exceptionally attractive man”; and driving while text-messaging leads to “a substantial increase in the risk of being involved in a safety-critical event such as a crash.” Thank you, social science!)

That movie was an almost miraculous fusion of filmmaking art and real-life narrative full of twists and reversals. “More Than a Game,” which looks back on the achievements of a high school basketball team in Akron, Ohio, that happened to include the future N.B.A. superstar LeBron James, is halfway there. The art is lacking, but the material is remarkable enough to make up for pedestrian filmmaking. Akron’s Little Dribblers Who Became Big Shots Documentary Films and Programs James, LeBron Movies",A.

News,Sports,Sports,"A Chicago victory in Copenhagen on Friday is expected to generate a network TV bidding war over the 2016 Olympics. Chicago’s bid to host the 2016 Summer Olympics would probably bring in more money from a United States TV network  and more from corporate sponsors  than Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo or Madrid, industry executives say. The International Olympic Committee will pick a city Friday in Copenhagen, setting the stage for the negotiations that will provide the bulk of its television revenue. A Chicago win is expected to generate a three-way bidding war between NBC Universal, ESPN and Fox.

Review,Metro,New York,"“Hairspray” is being staged at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., but with a less sizable set design than was used on Broadway. You can’t resist the upbeat charms of “Hairspray” at Paper Mill Playhouse, where the cheerful musical about a big-haired girl with outsize dreams is being happily replicated on a somewhat smaller scale than the 2002 Broadway hit that ran for more than six years. Though the scenery is slimmed-down, this fast-paced crowd-pleaser packs every ounce of its original whirlwind appeal.

News,Metro,New York,"At a Manhattan restaurant with a genre-busting menu from one of TV’s Iron Chefs, a neighborhood resident dines with his parents visiting from Germany. One of the glitzy, fine-dining restaurants that brought the flash of Las Vegas to a formerly bereft stretch of western Chelsea about five years ago, Morimoto still packs in a mix of celebrities, downtown creative types, tourists and international businesspeople. It has an eye-popping white-on-white décor — including an illuminated wall made of 17,500 water bottles — and an over-the-top genre-busting menu from Masaharu Morimoto, one of the stars of “Iron Chef America,” on the Food Network. But the restaurant, on 10th Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, also manages a casual ease, which on Tuesday drew in a regular customer indulging in the $120 omakase menu at the sushi bar; co-workers sharing cocktails and snacks in the subterranean lounge; and a neighbor entertaining his parents visiting from Fulda, a small town in Germany.

Brief,Foreign,World,"President Viktor F. Yanukovich’s control over the government grew on Friday when the constitutional court handed him some of Parliament’s powers.  President Viktor F. Yanukovich’s control over the government grew on Friday when the constitutional court handed him some of Parliament’s powers. The court overturned changes in the government’s structure, adopted in 2004, that had split authority between the president and Parliament. Mr. Yanukovich, above, who took office this year, praised the decision, saying that he hoped to go even further by holding a referendum on a new Constitution. But his opponents said he had rigged the court and was trying to create an authoritarian system. Mr. Yanukovich’s allies control Parliament, and he has a loyal prime minister. But if opposition parties make gains in new elections, it will be harder for them to block his agenda.

While taking photographs at the conservation department of the J. Paul Getty Museum, I became captivated by X-rays of art objects from the museum’s permanent collections.

News,Metro,New York,"A Connecticut museum maintains the estate of Alfred Pope and the vision of his daughter, Theodate Pope Riddle, who designed the early-20th-century site. Imagine a day in the life of the Pope family at Hill-Stead, their 33,000-square-foot, white clapboard, Colonial Revival-style home perched on a hilltop in Farmington. Perhaps they served lunch in their expansive dining room to a gathering of friends that included James McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, Henry James, Edith Wharton and President Theodore Roosevelt. Maybe they retired to the drawing room, where, surrounded by Impressionist masterpieces, they enjoyed a concert performed on a custom-designed, six-legged Steinway grand piano. After that, they might have headed out for a round of golf on the six-hole course on the grounds, or taken a stroll along one of the paths that meandered through the picturesque farmland and vistas of the Litchfield Hills.

Review,BookReview,Books,"Nicholson Baker’s ardent novel about poetry — with its hero trying, and mostly failing, to write an anthology introduction — actually does justice to poetry. Novels about poetry are a dodgy proposition. After all, novelists already have a near monopoly on narrative and discursive fiction — turf once claimed by poetry — and it seems almost impolite for our prose writers, having triumphed so thoroughly over their sister art, to set themselves up as tour guides to poetry’s dwindling estate. And let’s face it, stories involving poets tend to be hokey or, worse, excruciatingly literary. Maybe the spires of libraries rise darkly in the gloaming; maybe bookish amour unfolds amid bosomy fields laden with the fleeting fruits of summer. At best, the author follows the course Stephen King takes in “The Tommyknockers” and skims over his protagonist’s occupation in order to concentrate on the perilous effects of buried alien spacecraft.

Review,BookReview,Books,"This history of health policy and the Oval Office shows that the presidents who made the biggest steps in the direction of universal care have acted despite their economic advisers. This timely and insightful book puts Barack Obama’s current quest for universal health insurance in historical context and gives new meaning to the audacity of hope. Universal health care has bedeviled, eluded or defeated every president for the last 75 years. Franklin Roosevelt left it out of Social Security because he was afraid it would be too complicated and attract fierce resistance. Harry Truman fought like hell for it but ultimately lost. Dwight Eisenhower reshaped the public debate over it. John Kennedy was passionate about it. Lyndon Johnson scored the first and last major victory on the road toward achieving it. Richard Nixon devised the essential elements of all future designs for it. Jimmy Carter tried in vain to re-engineer it. The first George Bush toyed with it. Bill Clinton lost it and then never mentioned it again. George W. expanded it significantly, but only for retirees.

News,Metropolitan,New York,"Thirty years after the Tompkins Square riots, the problems around homelessness remain the same. In many ways the modern era of class warfare in New York can be traced to a humid night in August 1988, when Tompkins Square Park erupted in violence over an effort to impose a curfew in a space that had found new distinction largely as a tent city for the homeless. Protesters screamed “Kill yuppies!” not far from the Christodora, a building that had once been a settlement house but two years earlier had been converted to luxury condominiums. Bottles were thrown, arrests were made and the police were called out for various brutalities. What was clear is that simply moving people out of the park — in 1989, with “an operation of nearly military complexity” The Times noted — would accomplish very little.

Review,BookReview,Books,"In a new book, Timothy Egan traces the Klan’s expansion in the 1920s across American political and civic life. Then its leader, David C. Stephenson, committed murder. The scene, in some ways, could not have been more commonplace. On July 4, 1923, in a creekside park in Kokomo, Ind., families celebrated Independence Day with flags and bunting, watermelon and pie, patriotic songs, a parade. Commonplace — except that these families, many thousands in number, wore the white hoods and robes of the Ku Klux Klan. Banners insisted that “America is for Americans”; floats portrayed Klansmen defending women from Black people and Catholics. As the day’s featured speaker — David C. Stephenson, Grand Dragon of the Realm of Indiana — stepped out of the rear cockpit of a Klan-branded biplane, members of the crowd dropped to their knees and, in rapture, reached out their arms. “My worthy subjects,” Stephenson exulted.

First Citizens BancShares, a family-run bank in North Carolina, announced last Sunday that it was acquiring Silicon Valley Bank, capping off a tumultuous month for the California lender whose collapse touched off a wider banking crisis. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized control of SVB and its assets on March 10, after a run on deposits left it insolvent, and SVB filed for bankruptcy a week later. First Citizens’ deal with the F.D.I.C. to take over the bank involved the purchase of about $72 billion in loans at a $16.5 billion discount. First Citizens also took control of all of the bank’s roughly $56 billion in deposits. But an additional $90 billion in SVB’s securities remain under the purview of the F.D.I.C. The collapse of SVB was followed in short succession by two other bank failures. Credit Suisse, which was bought by its rival UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, and Signature Bank.

Michigan’s Upper Peninsula encompasses more than 16,000 square miles of northern hardwood forest, broken here and there by hardscrabble towns whose year-round population is slowly bleeding away. In “Hunter’s Moon,” Philip Caputo’s powerful new collection of linked stories, the U.P. serves as a repository of damaged men. Elderly fathers are disappointed by their sons.

Review,BookReview,Books,"For better and for worse, in sickness and in health, Clare Pollard’s debut novel, “Delphi,” revisits the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. Clare Pollard’s debut novel, “Delphi,” covers roughly a year in the life of a London classics professor, wife and mother who is struggling during the pandemic. Her challenges include but are not limited to: the possible fraying of her marriage; her 10-year-old son’s loneliness, confusion and frustration; and her desire to hold her family together against all odds. While the plot is peppered with a handful of specific events — Zoom school, a holiday trip, a Covid diagnosis, a dalliance with a colleague — the main driver of “Delphi” is a strange miasmic anxiety shot through with boredom.

For three years in the 1980s, my father, who was a partner at a class-action securities firm that bore his name, had an ongoing legal case in Oregon. As a child, I had no idea what this meant, only that he often returned to New York from his long business trips with two things: a stupid dad joke, and a tiny spoon, purchased in the gift shop of an airport.

Review,BookReview,Books,"Elisabeth Griffith’s “Formidable” chronicles American women’s endless battle for fair treatment. On July 16, 1998, Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed an audience of 16,000 gathered at Seneca Falls, N.Y., to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first women’s rights convention. “Imagine, if you will, that you are Charlotte Woodward,” Clinton preached, “a 19-year-old glove maker working and living in Waterloo. Every day you sit for hours sewing … working for small wages you cannot even keep … knowing that if you marry, your children and even the clothes on your body will belong to your husband.” During her speech, Clinton claimed to hear the echoes of her predecessors — Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, Lucretia Mott, Frederick Douglass — as she gripped a podium not far from the Methodist Chapel where Elizabeth Cady Stanton first demanded voting rights for women to a crowd of 300. The church had since been converted into a laundromat and car dealership, and as Clinton spoke, her husband, then president of the United States, was having a sexual affair with a White House intern. Within months, he would be impeached. Within a decade and a half, Hillary herself would run for president of the most powerful country in the world. We’ve Come a Long Way … Maybe?

Review,BookReview,Books,"“The Visionaries,” by Wolfram Eilenberger, examines the divergent theories of self and other developed in a time of crisis by Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Ayn Rand and Simone Weil. If hell is other people, then so, too, is this world. Accepting the reality of others can take time. During a general strike in France in 1934, Simone de Beauvoir felt no particular urge to stand in solidarity with workers, including her colleagues at the lycée where she was teaching. “The existence of Otherness remained a danger to me,” she later recalled. “Around us other people circled, pleasant, odious or ridiculous: They had no eyes with which to observe me. I alone could see.” How Four Female Philosophers Responded to a Dire Decade Books and Literature Arendt, Hannah Beauvoir, Simone de Eilenberger, Wolfram Rand, Ayn Weil, Simone The Visionaries: Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil, and the Power of Philosophy in Dark Times (Book) Time of the Magicians: Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer, Heidegger, and the Decade That Reinvented Philosophy (Book)",Jennifer Szalai

Anyone who has ever struggled to rest throughout an entire night — which I imagine is all of us, at one time or another — will sympathize with Marina Benjamin, who plumbs the agony of her own sleeplessness in her new book, simply titled “Insomnia.” In it, Benjamin describes the different varieties of middle-of-the-night dislocation — nights when “the thickening, sense-dulling” darkness “hangs velvety as a pall,” or the “luminous moonlit nights, lurid nights, when everything feels heightened.” She recounts her own experiences and frustrations, but also calls on the works of a wide range of others to illuminate the subject, like the poet Rumi, the painter Magritte and the philosopher David Hume; as well as fictional characters, like Odysseus’s wife, Penelope (“his absence stirs her desire, but then her insomnia curdles that desire into despair,” Benjamin writes). Below, she discusses the particularly bad bout of insomnia that inspired her to write the book, the recurrent image of sleeping women in classical art and more.

News,BookReview,Books,"Ed Park’s latest Graphic Content column looks at new work from Matt Madden and R. Kikuo Johnson. Matt Madden is the stuntman-philosopher of American comics. His best-known book, “99 Ways to Tell a Story,” riffed on Raymond Queneau’s “Exercises in Style.” That bible of experimental writing from 1947 retold a mundane scenario — a mild contretemps on a Paris bus — with precision (“In a bus of the S line, 10 meters long, 3 wide, 6 high …”), in Cockney (“A sees vis young Froggy bloke, caw bloimey …”) and so on. Transposing the conceit to the graphic medium, Madden devised his own non-anecdote: Man leaves desk, opens fridge, tells someone the time, then can’t recall why he stood up in the first place. This ball of nothing gets reworked as (among other things) a batch of daily comic strips, a piece of the Bayeux Tapestry and a do-it-yourself kit in which each element (from wristwatch to lettering) is separated as if in a box, ready for assembly. The hilarity mounts, but so does the mystery of what makes a story. In flaunting style over substance, he shows them to be one and the same.

Its popularity led to a book deal for the author and illustrator Jeff Kinney, who turned the comics into a best-selling children’s book that combined text with crudely drawn cartoons. The book begot more than a dozen sequels; three spinoffs; a Children’s Theater Company musical; and six feature film adaptations, including two different versions based on the original book — one in live action, from 2010, and one animated, from 2021.

She had an epiphany while talking with a family member about wearing her wedding dress only once: “Why not bring along the dress that makes me feel so beautiful to the most beautiful places in the world?” The couple documented their travels on their blog and Instagram account, “Marry Me In Travel.” Ms. Aust, who purchased a Watters Ferrera gown at a trunk show at the Bridal Garden, a bridal boutique in Evesham Township, N.J., captured the attention of many including the style team at Watters. “We loved following their journey and seeing how they styled Ferrera,” said Sydney Watters Dunbar the company’s style director. “We are always inspired by our brides, but Nick and Zoe took this to a new level.”  Adventure in a Wedding Dress Dresses Fashion and Apparel Marriages",Charanna Alexander

Review,BookReview,Books,"An excerpt from “A Woman Like Her: The Story Behind the Honor Killing of a Social Media Star,” by Sanam Maher It takes a little over two hours to drive from Multan, a city in southern Punjab, to the village of Shah Sadar Din. After many checkpoints, where officers shake down the young men on motorbikes, some riding two or three at a time, their thin arms curled around each other’s waists, you’ll see a silty brown river snaking past men lounging on charpoys by its banks. On the way, if you admire the fields of sugarcane, each stalk taller than a man, your driver, a local who has played under the green sway of these plants as a child, will scoff. The ganna is short this year because there has been little water. He has seen these plants soar to fifteen feet. On the side of the road men and women stand by smoking steel vats, stirring a muddy treacle, folding crushed almonds and dried fruit into the soupy folds of the molasses.

LINDA RONSTADT: THE SOUND OF MY VOICE (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. “If I were going to choose something to do, it would not be to stand up in front of a lot of people,” the singer Linda Ronstadt says in this documentary. “But I love to sing, I love to sing, I love music. So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music.” That’s not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn’t have the typical rock star’s career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. (“People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself,” she says in the documentary, “but I never invented myself to start with.”) Her varied career is the focus here; it’s discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. “The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.

The only problem is that you are not, from many perspectives, quite unique in the way you think you are: Much of the time, your feelings are shared by so many millions of people that you are merely another face in the crowd.

The roads — a pure, unpaved hell — tended to discourage folks. Fifty, maybe 60, people a day made the four-mile drive from the highway to the front gate, where many simply turned around and headed back the way they came.

Op-Ed,Opinion & Editorial,Opinion,"The backlash against the president’s fulminations — and his policies — is stronger than many analysts realize. President Trump’s short-lived family separation policy extended the hard line on immigration he promoted during his presidential campaign. Many analysts believe that this strategy helped him win the election by politicizing latent nativist sentiment among white Americans. At his rallies, Mr. Trump consistently propounded a view of immigrants as criminals and miscreants, not to mention a cause of unemployment and wage stagnation among native-born citizens. As president, he has continued to use dehumanizing language in reference to immigrants, words like “vermin,” “infest” and “animals.” On Sunday, he dared Democrats to push for the abolition of the Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency, claiming that if they pursued the idea, they would “never win another election.” What if Trump’s Nativism Actually Hurts Him?

Despite the urgency of the moment, the mayoral primary on June 22 failed to capture the attention of even a simple majority of New Yorkers, so it was not without irony that the country’s eventual fascination with it was born of a bizarre, bureaucratic error. Treating the primaries as a Netflix series demanding a teaser weeks ahead of showtime, the city’s Board of Elections announced the preliminary results of ranked-choice voting earlier this week, before the final count was due later this month. Needlessly released, the new tabulations were initially inaccurate — phantom votes from a test run had been accidentally included in the tally — prompting drama, upheaval and the threat of cascading lawsuits.

In 1947, having left Nazi-occupied Vienna for the quaint idyll of Princeton, N.J., seven years before, the mathematician Kurt Gödel was studying for his citizenship exam and became preoccupied with the mechanisms of American government. A worried friend recalled Gödel talking about “some inner contradictions” in the Constitution that would make it legally possible “for somebody to become a dictator and set up a fascist regime.” Gödel started to bring this up at his actual examination, telling the judge that the United States could become a dictatorship — “I can prove it!” — before his friends (one of whom was Albert Einstein) managed to shut him up so that the naturalization process could go on as planned.

In that film, Samara, a demonic orphan drowned in a well by her tormented adoptive mother, rose from the dead, via VHS tape, to terrorize the living. The particulars of the story are less important than the version that has lodged itself in our imaginations: the tape itself, a choppy cut of generically alarming images; the ringing phone, and the voice on the other end of the line whispering seven days; the inhuman form crawling out of the television; the waterlogged face peeking out from behind the wall of stringy black hair. “The Ring” was both horrifying and meaningfully divergent from its source material, a Japanese book and film series. The third installment of the American series, “Rings” (2017), was a minor commercial success and a massive critical flop. For now, the franchise appears to be on pause.

Just to pick a few across a vast and varied spectrum: Ann Richards’s election to the governorship in 1990 seemed miraculous — a sign that Texas had turned a corner and was finally heading in a progressive direction.

Bush and his ascendancy to the presidency in the 2000 election, a step in a different direction but no less surprising to those who had seen, up close and personal, his pretty confounding lack of gravitas.

Review,Arts & Culture,Arts,"This week’s “Fear the Walking Dead” finally shed some light on Victor Strand. This week’s episode, “Blood in the Streets,” is all about debt. Owing it. Owning it. Pardoning it, and calling it in.

Naomi Klein in her 2007 book “The Shock Doctrine,” argued that capitalism, in the post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina era of privatization, monetizes disaster and disproportionately benefits the uber rich.

As a middle-aged man with a background in journalism, Lyons was an odd fit for a company specializing in Internet marketing — a field he admits to knowing nothing about. Once he got started, the experience was even more alienating than he’d imagined. He found himself cast as the “old man” in an office populated by college graduates half his age.

A peasant girl who had survived war and rape in her rural village, she had migrated to Da Nang to escape persecution from both Vietnamese Communists and anti-Communists. In 1972 she married an American and moved to the United States, and in 1989 she would publish her powerful autobiographical account of being caught between two sides, “When Heaven and Earth Changed Places.” In 2017, it remains perhaps the only first-person book in English about the experiences of Vietnamese villagers caught in the crossfire of the Vietnam War.

William lent Melville a book by his father, Owen Chase: “Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex.” Melville had read Jeremiah Reynolds’s violent account of a sperm whale “white as wool,” named — for his haunt near Mocha Island, off the coast of Chile — Mocha Dick. It’s unknown what led Melville to tweak Mocha to “Moby.” Good thing he did, and that Starbuck was the name he gave his first mate rather than his captain.

It is this eye for the rhythms and textures of life — of millennial digital media, of the death by a thousand cuts offered by workplace racism, of Maryland suburbia — that makes this novel vivid and inviting. “Homebodies” is the story of a young Black woman’s quarter-life crisis as she wonders what her place in the world will be.

Review,BookReview,Books,"“Shy,” by Max Porter, offers a look inside the multidimensional consciousness of a troubled young man. Shuffling out into a damp, black English night toward a muddy pond in the year 1995, a kid bears the weight of the world on his shoulders. That, plus a real rucksack stuffed with flint rocks. This is Shy, a drum-and-bass-obsessed boy with behavioral problems, and a protagonist in whom myth and bathos slyly collide.

Review,BookReview,Books,"“The World at My Back,” by the German writer Thomas Melle, presents the details of his psychotic breakdowns and their painful aftermaths. Living with bipolar disorder — formerly called manic depression — is hard enough, but memoirists afflicted with it face an additional quandary: how to turn their bizarre and frightening experiences into books that grip rather than repel the reader. When they are successful, such reports grant us rare access to the psychic antipodes — a chaotic realm of hyper-signification and cosmic paranoia far beyond the boundaries of healthy consciousness. Joining the likes of Kay Redfield Jamison’s “An Unquiet Mind,” Leonora Carrington’s “Down Below” and, more recently, Arnold Thomas Fanning’s harrowing “Mind on Fire,” is the German novelist and translator Thomas Melle’s illuminating memoir of the illness that has devastated his life.

It was pleasant, I had often been told, for a writer to live somewhere where reading and writing were accorded the highest respect, and it was true that — in Paris at least — these were semipublic activities: In every park and cafe, on the Metro and on the benches along the Seine, people were openly engaged in what for me had always been the most private and solitary of occupations.

News,BookReview,Books,"A journal entry prompted Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim to seek out the novels of Irmgard Keun, once dubbed the “It Girl” of German literature. I first came across the name “Gilgi” on a page of my grandmother Käthe’s diary from 1932, tucked between mentions of “Shanghai Express” with Marlene Dietrich and a performance by the Jewish cabaret star Dela Lipinskaja. “Such courage!” Käthe wrote, of the character Gilgi. I was curious for any glimpse into my grandmother’s mind during this chapter of her life when she was an expressionist dancer in Hamburg and sported boyish haircuts and berets. She had recently fallen in love with my grandfather Hermann and was summoning the courage to divorce her husband. From Wikipedia I learned that “Gilgi” was the first novel by a writer named Irmgard Keun (1905-82), who had been the It Girl of the German literary scene in the final years of the Weimar Republic.

News,BookReview,Books,"A Trump biography for teenagers, a picture book biography of Elizabeth Warren, Justice Sotomayor’s life story for kids, and more of this fall’s books for future voters. It’s a question parents have wrestled with since the 2016 presidential election: How do we explain this political moment to our children? I, for one, was hoping the answer would not involve a book aimed at teenagers in which a candidate’s obscene reference to female anatomy appears on Page 2, but that is where we are. In UNPRESIDENTED: A Biography of Donald Trump (Feiwel and Friends, 384 pp., $19.99; ages 12 and up), Martha Brockenbrough provides an encyclopedic tale of the rise of Donald J. Trump. Brockenbrough’s version is, unapologetically, a liberal’s framing of events. Then again, I’m not sure if a nonpartisan book about Trump could grow out of the current climate. For now, there is this thorough, hard-hitting volume that seeks to explain Trump, from the time he was born with a silver spoon and “golden hair, pink cheeks and a tiny pucker of a mouth,” to his shocker of a presidential campaign (“candidates typically don’t insult the parents of soldiers who die in combat”).

Daniel Ek, a founder of Spotify and its current chief executive, sits in front of a U.S. Senate committee hearing. Or rather: A Swedish actor playing Ek sits in front of a Senate hearing, as imagined by a Swedish production designer. A fictitious senator named Landy is grilling him, hard. “Your business model just doesn’t work for musicians, does it?” she asks. Her tone makes it obvious that she already knows the answer Ek would give if he were willing to tell the truth. As she peppers him with facts and figures about Spotify’s market share and artists’ measly cut of its revenue, Ek tries to fight back, insisting that his streaming service, whatever its shortcomings, is still the best path forward for musicians hoping to make a living from their art. But the more Landy presses, the more shaken Ek looks, as though he didn’t expect the questioning to be so tough. There is a moment in which it seems he might be considering the possibility that her criticisms have merit: Maybe, despite all of his company’s rhetoric about freedom for artists, he really is just a new breed of music-industry monopolist.

Review,BookReview,Books,"“Same Bed Different Dreams” is the rare sophomore novel that has the wild, freewheeling ambition of a debut. Just after I’d registered for my first semester of college courses, I was meandering among a concourse of clubs and teams, fending off their grinning ambassadors, when a newspaper headline caught my eye: “U.S. Says Soviet Downed Korean Airliner; 269 Lost.” By today’s standards the KAL 007 tragedy seems like a distant relic of Ronald Reagan’s “evil empire” rhetoric, but at the time it was a Cold War grenade: Jet fighters scrambled, sabers rattled, tinfoil-hat theories spiked. Late in his lush, labyrinthine “Same Bed Different Dreams,” Ed Park recreates that moment, twisting the doomed flight’s number into a James Bond motif that resonates throughout the novel. Double agents, sinister corporations, slasher films, U.F.O.s: If Park’s suitcase is stuffed, well, it’s an inspired choice for an odyssey that unpacks, in Pynchonesque fashion, Korean history and American paranoia.

The winter after Donald Trump was elected president, strangers began appearing in a parking lot on southern Washington State’s Long Beach Peninsula, at the port where the oyster boats come and go.

The strangers sat in their vehicle and watched the workers arrive in their trucks. They watched the workers grab their gear and walk to the docks. The workers watched them watching, too, and they soon began to realize that the men were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. When the workers made eye contact, the officers nodded politely, but they said very little. For weeks, they just watched. Then the workers began to vanish.

News,SundayBusiness,Business Day,"Wall Street volatility continued. Tallying the costs of Hurricane Ian has just begun. And a report on the strength of the job market is coming this week. The new British government’s announcement last week that it planned to make drastic tax cuts sent markets tumbling, the pound sinking and the Bank of England scrambling to restore some calm. The panic stemmed from fear that the tax and spending measures proposed by Britain’s recently appointed prime minister, Liz Truss, would add to soaring inflation in the country, running up against the central bank’s efforts to rein it in. Ms. Truss’s government argues that cutting taxes will stimulate investments and that the benefits will buoy the rest of the economy — but investors do not appear convinced. Their unease rippled throughout Europe and to the United States, where benchmark indexes slid. The pound hit its lowest recorded point, creeping near parity with the dollar. On Wednesday, the Bank of England stepped in, saying it will undertake large-scale purchases of British government bonds in the coming weeks to “restore orderly market conditions.” Its forceful intervention pushed the pound back up slightly and helped markets regain some of their losses.

To Milton William Cooper, the truth was out there. Way out there. Not in an “X-Files” way — in fact, after dabbling in extraterrestrial theories, Cooper eventually thought U.F.O.s were “possibly the single greatest hoax in history,” just another threat fabricated to keep a docile public in thrall to an increasingly one-world government. Cooper was in the earthly conspiracy business. He was killed in a shootout with police shortly after the events of Sept. 11, 2001, which many say he prophesied. His book “Behold a Pale Horse” has been wildly popular among conspiracy theorists since its publication in 1991. In “Pale Horse Rider,” Mark Jacobson tells the story of Cooper’s life, and explores the roots and consequences of his distinctly American brand of fevered conjecture.

(On Instagram, she refers to it as “my Big Chubby Baby of a novel.”) One would be hard-pressed to locate a review that doesn’t describe this multigenerational epic, exploring Black history and family legacy through a young woman’s eyes, as “sprawling” or “sweeping.” On Page 9 of this issue, our reviewer writes, “‘The Love Songs of W. E. B. Du Bois’ is quite simply the best book that I have read in a very, very long time.” It enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 4, almost 25 years to the day after Oprah announced her very first book club pick: Jacqueline Mitchard’s “The Deep End of the Ocean,” another debut novel that went on to be a best seller (for 16 months). In 1996, when Oprah announced the choice on her talk show, she said: “I want to get the whole country reading again. Those of you who haven’t been reading, I think books are important!” She explained how the club would work: Readers who wanted to have dinner with Mitchard could send a letter to a Chicago P.O. box or “write us at America Online, those of us who know how to do that.” The studio audience smiled politely and clapped.

Afterward, the Chilean army announced that suicide was the official cause of death, which many Chileans distrusted, if not flatly rejected.

Perhaps she’d learned them in the early days after the war, when she’d performed with Holocaust survivors at a hospital in 1945.
