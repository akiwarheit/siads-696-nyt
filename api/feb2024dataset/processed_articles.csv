One such screen was embedded in each of the six metal workbenches that lined the edges of the space; at the center of the room was a wooden platform, raised several feet off the ground — a surveillance tower from which visitors could assume the perspective of an employer presiding over the stations below. Lin, 45, was partially inspired by the Malaysian-born anthropologist Aihwa Ong’s research into accounts of demonic possession and paranormal activity among a group of women in rural Malaysia in the 1970s. The women had suffered lithium poisoning while working at battery factories and began to break into fits of destructive rage during their shifts.

News,Style & Fashion,T Magazine,"Expert advice from professional travelers on what to bring and where to put it. Ask any frequent traveler their rules for a trip, and you’ll likely hear the same advice: Never check a bag. Carry-on only. But fitting everything you need, especially for a longer stay, into one small suitcase and one handbag or backpack requires some ingenuity: The maximum dimensions for luggage going into most overhead bins are 22 by 14 by 9 inches, and though the majority of domestic flights don’t have — or at least don’t enforce — weight limits, some international and trans-Pacific flights do (certain Delta flights to Asia, for example, have a limit of 22 pounds, while Hawaiian Airlines’s maximum is 25 pounds). The payoff, if you do get it right: quicker airport experiences that don’t involve the risk of lost luggage and, upon arrival, fewer decisions about what to wear.

When the Ranch at Malibu opened in 2010 as a luxury health resort on 200 acres in California’s Santa Monica Mountains, its approach was somewhat radical: Guests signed up for a full week of group hikes, fitness classes, spa treatments, nutrition consults and communal, organic meals without caffeine, gluten, soy or dairy. The goal, says its founder Alex Glasscock, was “for people to mentally and physically reset and recharge.” On April 15, a second location, the Ranch at Hudson Valley, is scheduled to open near Tuxedo Park, N.Y., in a slate-and-stone lakefront mansion surrounded by state parks. Glasscock hopes the 25-room property, which he describes as “like a big, luxury dorm,” will facilitate connections between those who stay. Guests will do yoga under the ornate plaster ceiling of the former ballroom and, in Glasscock’s ideal world, come to dinner in their pajamas and robes. This new outpost offers a few additional treatments including colonics and energy healings — which incorporate techniques such as hypnosis and sound therapy. In winter, guests can sled or snowshoe, and in summer there’s paddleboarding on the lake. The Ranch has also relaxed a few of the restrictions: You can book three nights at the Hudson Valley property instead of the seven required in Malibu, and, in concession to the most common request of all, caffeine is no longer taboo — organic Nicaraguan coffee is served at breakfast in both locations.

News,Style & Fashion,Style,"A reader had hoped that her grandmother’s ring would stay in the family, perhaps to pass on to her daughter, but her former sister-in-law has so far refused to give it back. When my brother got engaged, he gave his fiancée — with my blessing — a ring that is a family heirloom. It belonged to our grandmother, who died before we were born. It didn’t occur to me that the ring was possibly leaving our family, which is what happened when they later divorced. My brother asked his ex-wife if she would return the ring, but she refused. I’ve tried to let this go: It’s just an object and not worth a lot of money, but I still harbor hard feelings. I was fond of my former sister-in-law; she was sweet to me and my kids. But we don’t have many things that belonged to my grandparents, and I’d rather give the ring to my daughter than let a stranger hang on to it. (My brother’s ex-wife doesn’t have children.)

Recipe,,,"nan This Italian frozen dessert looks almost identical to ice cream, but has a few key differences: Compared to its cousin, gelato is made with more milk than cream, and uses fewer or no eggs, instead leaning on other stabilizers to keep it from becoming icy as it freezes. Here, cornstarch is the stabilizer for this easy at-home version, providing a smooth, creamy texture. Because gelato has a lower butterfat percentage than ice cream, it’s best served slightly warmer; for best results, let it soften on the counter for a couple minutes before serving. This recipe makes a basic vanilla gelato, but you can easily make different flavors by adding mix-ins such as chopped chocolate, <span><a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024731-dulce-de-leche""><span>dulce de leche</span></a></span></span><span>, or <span><a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016615-chocolate-ganache""><span>chocolate ganache</span></a></span></span><span> once the gelato is churned.

Recipe,,,"nan Tender white rolls stuffed with smoky grilled meat, creamy avocado, juicy tomatoes, pickled jalape<span>ñ</span>os and red onion, the Mexican torta is a much-loved sandwich that likely originated in Puebla during the French occupation in the 1860s. Mexican bakers were inspired by baguettes, and created telera, a smaller, softer loaf with signature hash marks across the top. While the exact history is blurry, one thing remains true: like any good sandwich, good bread is key. Telera or bolillo rolls are traditional here, although according to Claudette Zepeda, a San Diego chef who specializes in regional Mexican cooking, ciabatta is an acceptable substitute.

While pasta paglia e fieno typically uses reduced heavy cream as its sauce, this recipe keeps it a little lighter by decreasing the amount of cream and instead relying on eggs to give the sauce its clingy, glossy texture, like in a good carbonara.

Cachaça, another sugar cane spirit, is included. Marshall Minaya, a partner and the beverage director, and the head bartender, Carlos Kennedy-Lopez, worked to develop drinks to showcase the various spirits. The food is Mexican, by the chef Carmelo Calixto, and offers many of the usual suspects: guacamole, empanadas, tacos, enchiladas and carne asada.

It’s comforting with its buttery softness and complex with its blend of five extracts (vanilla, rum, coconut, lemon and almond). The celebrity chef Carla Hall got this recipe, among other beloved soul food dishes, from her maternal grandmother, Jessie Mae Price. This family dessert was served at every Christmas celebration in Tennessee and wrapped and shipped off to the grandchildren as well. It’s a keeping cake, the kind that tastes even better over time, and meant to be shared. Ms. Hall wanted to recreate the tenderness that her granny achieved through sifted cake flour without sending home cooks to the store for yet another ingredient, so she swapped in some cornstarch instead. If you don’t have that in your pantry, using only all-purpose flour works just fine too, as does any combination of extracts you can find or have on hand.

Recipe,,,"nan Justin Cherry, a foodways historian, chef and <a href=""https://www.halfcrownbakehouse.com/"">resident baker</a> at George Washington’s Mount Vernon, developed this recipe for hoecakes (cornmeal pancakes) using archival sources that describe the first president’s fondness for the dish. Corn was a cash crop at Mount Vernon, and the estate had a successful mill that could process up to 8,000 pounds of flour and cornmeal in one day. Hoecakes were so esteemed by Washington that Hercules Posey and the other enslaved chefs likely made them daily. Given the president’s dental issues and wealth, the cornmeal used for his hoecakes was probably a finer, higher-quality grind than the coarser meal given to his enslaved community as weekly rations. This recipe, created by Mr. Cherry, uses stone-ground cornmeal, and produces a pronounced corn flavor. It’s important to make sure your butter is hot so the hoecakes crisp nicely while their interiors remain moist, retaining an almost creamy texture. George Washington ate these cornmeal cakes “swimming” in butter and honey, but maple syrup works well, too. Hoecakes ",Ramin Ganeshram
